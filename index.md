I am a quantum solutions architect at SavantX. My role primarily revolves around transforming challenges from various fields into problems that can be addressed by quantum annealers.

Here are some past topics of interest:

**Modeling of complex systems:**
Complex systems are common in fields ranging from physics, economics to social sciences. Using computational simulations, we can validate or challenge novel theories. I am particularly interested in using numerical methods in models to explore the impact of perturbations on the stability.


**Combinatorial Optimization:**
Most real world problems are quite convoluted. Addressing these problems poses multiple challenging questions: Is there a complete set of variables that can describe the system? Does the problem belong to a recognized problem class? What constraints do the variables have?

**Statistics:**
Although once a dreaded subject, I have come to appreciate the importance of statistics. Two instances that have piqued my interest are: 
The Gaussian process, leverages Bayesâ€™ theorem for function approximation and quantifying uncertainty.
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), achieve their generative capabilities through the inclusion of noise.

Some of my projects are on [github](https://github.com/steenmalcolm).
